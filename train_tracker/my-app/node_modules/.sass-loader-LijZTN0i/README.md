# sass-loader

Loads a Sass/SCSS file and compiles it to CSS.

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install `sass-loader`:

```console
npm install sass-loader sass webpack --save-dev
```

or

```console
yarn add -D sass-loader sass webpack
```

or

```console
pnpm add -D sass-loader sass webpack
```

`sass-loader` requires you to install either [Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass), [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) on your own (more documentation can be found below) or [Sass Embedded](https://github.com/sass/embedded-host-node).

This allows you to control the versions of all your dependencies, and to choose which Sass implementation to use.

> ℹ️ We highly recommend using [Dart Sass](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass).

> ⚠ [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) does not work with [Yarn PnP](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/pnp/) feature and doesn't support [@use rule](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/use).

> ⚠ [Sass Embedded](https://github.com/sass/embedded-host-node) is experimental and in `beta`, therefore some features may not work

Chain the `sass-loader` with the [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader) and the [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) to immediately apply all styles to the DOM or the [mini-css-extract-plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/mini-css-extract-plugin) to extract it into a separate file.

Then add the loader to your Webpack configuration. For example:

**app.js**

```js
import "./style.scss";
```

**style.scss**

```scss
$body-color: red;

body {
  color: $body-color;
}
```

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          // Creates `style` nodes from JS strings
          "style-loader",
          // Translates CSS into CommonJS
          "css-loader",
          // Compiles Sass to CSS
          "sass-loader",
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Finally run `webpack` via your preferred method.

### Resolving `import` at-rules

Webpack provides an [advanced mechanism to resolve files](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/module-resolution/).

The `sass-loader` uses Sass's custom importer feature to pass all queries to the Webpack resolving engine.
Thus you can import your Sass modules from `node_modules`.

```scss
@import "bootstrap";
```

Using `~` is deprecated and can be removed from your code (**we recommend it**), but we still support it for historical reasons.
Why can you remove it? The loader will first try to resolve `@import` as a relative path. If it cannot be resolved, then the loader will try to resolve `@import` inside [`node_modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvemodules).

Prepending module paths with a `~` tells webpack to search through [`node_modules`](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolvemodules).

```scss
@import "~bootstrap";
```

It's important to prepend it with only `~`, because `~/` resolves to the home directory.
Webpack needs to distinguish between `bootstrap` and `~bootstrap` because CSS and Sass files have no special syntax for importing relative files.
Writing `@import "style.scss"` is the same as `@import "./style.scss";`

### Problems with `url(...)`

Since Sass implementations don't provide [url rewriting](https://github.com/sass/libsass/issues/532), all linked assets must be relative to the output.

- If you pass the generated CSS on to the `css-loader`, all urls must be relative to the entry-file (e.g. `main.scss`).
- If you're just generating CSS without passing it to the `css-loader`, it must be relative to your web root.

You will be disrupted by this first issue. It is natural to expect relative references to be resolved against the `.sass`/`.scss` file in which they are specified (like in regular `.css` files).

Thankfully there are a two solutions to this problem:

- Add the missing url rewriting using the [resolve-url-loader](https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader). Place it before `sass-loader` in the loader chain.
- Library authors usually provide a variable to modify the asset path. [bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) for example has an `$icon-font-path`.

## Options

- **[`implementation`](#implementation)**
- **[`sassOptions`](#sassoptions)**
- **[`sourceMap`](#sourcemap)**
- **[`additionalData`](#additionaldata)**
- **[`webpackImporter`](#webpackimporter)**
- **[`warnRuleAsWarning`](#warnruleaswarning)**

### `implementation`

Type:

```ts
type implementation = object | string;
```

Default: `sass`

The special `implementation` option determines which implementation of Sass to use.

By default the loader resolve the implementation based on your dependencies.
Just add required implementation to `package.json` (`sass` or `node-sass` package) and install dependencies.

Example where the `sass-loader` loader uses the `sass` (`dart-sass`) implementation:

**package.json**

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "sass-loader": "^7.2.0",
    "sass": "^1.22.10"
  }
}
```

Example where the `sass-loader` loader uses the `node-sass` implementation:

**package.json**

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "sass-loader": "^7.2.0",
    "node-sass": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

Beware the situation when `node-sass` and `sass` were installed! By default the `sass-loader` prefers `sass`.
In order to avoid this situation you can use the `implementation` option.

The `implementation` options either accepts `sass` (`Dart Sass`) or `node-sass` as a module.

#### `object`

For example, to use Dart Sass, you'd pass:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader",
          {
            loader: "sass-loader",
            options: {
              // Prefer `dart-sass`
              implementation: require("sass"),
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

#### `string`

For example, to use Dart Sass, you'd pass:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader",
          {
            loader: "sass-loader",
            options: {
              // Prefer `dart-sass`
              implementation: require.resolve("sass"),
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

Note that when using `sass` (`Dart Sass`), **synchronous compilation is twice as fast as asynchronous compilation** by default, due to the overhead of asynchronous callbacks.
To avoid this overhead, you can use the [fibers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers) package to call asynchronous importers from the synchronous code path.

We automatically inject the [`fibers`](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) package (setup `sassOptions.fiber`) for `Node.js` less v16.0.0 if is possible (i.e. you need install the [`fibers`](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) package).

> Fibers is not compatible with `Node.js` v16.0.0 or later ([see introduction to readme](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers)).

**package.json**

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "sass-loader": "^7.2.0",
    "sass": "^1.22.10",
    "fibers": "^4.0.1"
  }
}
```

You can disable automatically injecting the [`fibers`](https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers) package by passing a `false` value for the `sassOptions.fiber` option.

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader",
          {
            loader: "sass-loader",
            options: {
              implementation: require("sass"),
              sassOptions: {
                fiber: false,
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

You can also pass the `fiber` value using this code:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.s[ac]ss$/i,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader",
          {
            loader: "sass-loader",
            options: {
              implementation: require("sass"),
              sassOptions: {
                fiber: require("fibers"),
              },
            },
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```
